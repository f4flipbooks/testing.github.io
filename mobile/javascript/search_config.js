What many of us don’t realise, is that cancer          can be expensive.          4 in 5 people with cancer, will face money or financial problems          after their diagnosis, and knowing where to turn to for help          can seem bewildering.          Together with Macmillan Cancer Support, we run an advice          service for patients and families across Milton Keynes and          Buckinghamshire.  Our Advisers help hundreds of people          every year to access financial support and advise them on:           l Welfare Benefits          l Money and finances          l Housing          l Energy Bills          l Problems at work           If you, or someone you know, is living with cancer,          let us help you find a way to cope with the cost.
